## Code Refactor
One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it (recall that to refactor code is to improve it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. 

For this project, a imaginary marketing agency hired me to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. 
This included ensuring that all links functioned properly, the CSS properties were consolidated and semantic HTML elements replaced the non-semantic elements for clearer understanding. 


## Motivation
Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.
